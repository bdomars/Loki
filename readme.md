# NOTE: This is a fork of the official repo
- Updates here have not been pulled to official repo (mainly due to inactivity there)
- Updates here focus primarily on maintaining compability with Valheim 
- Any requests or questions should be in official repo

_If using a custom release from this fork, read the release notes carefully first._

__Credits to Wufflez for this app.__ 
(I just followed along the ride for a while, as a result of curiousity about Valheim/Unity internal workings more than anything else. WPF is not my cup of tea and a bit away from my comfort zone to be honest).
